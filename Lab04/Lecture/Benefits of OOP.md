From this example, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) provides several benefits compared to the procedural approach:

### **1. Encapsulation (Data Hiding)**
- **OOP:** The `__balance` attribute in the `BankAccount` class is private, meaning it can't be accessed directly from outside the class. This prevents unintended modifications and enforces controlled access through methods like `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `get_balance()`.
- **Procedural:** The `balance` is stored in a dictionary and can be accessed or modified directly, which increases the risk of accidental changes.

### **2. Code Organization and Reusability**
- **OOP:** Each `BankAccount` instance contains its own data and methods, making it easy to create multiple independent bank accounts.
- **Procedural:** A global dictionary (`accounts`) is used to track all accounts, which may lead to a more cluttered and error-prone structure when scaling up.

### **3. Scalability**
- **OOP:** The class can be extended with new methods and attributes, such as `transfer()` or `interest_rate()`, without affecting existing code.
- **Procedural:** Adding new functionality requires modifying multiple functions and maintaining consistency across different parts of the program.

### **4. Abstraction (Hiding Implementation Details)**
- **OOP:** The user interacts with the account through well-defined methods (`deposit`, `withdraw`, `get_balance`), without needing to know how balance is stored or managed internally.
- **Procedural:** The user must directly interact with a dictionary, which exposes internal implementation details and requires additional error handling.

### **5. Maintainability**
- **OOP:** Changes to the `BankAccount` class affect only the class itself, reducing the risk of breaking unrelated code.
- **Procedural:** Changes in one function may require modifications in multiple places, making maintenance more difficult.

### **6. Multiple Instances & Independence**
- **OOP:** Each account is an instance of `BankAccount`, meaning you can have multiple independent accounts (`account1`, `account2`, etc.) without interference.
- **Procedural:** The global dictionary must be carefully managed to avoid conflicts, which becomes harder as the program grows.

### **When to Use OOP vs Procedural?**
- **Use OOP** when building scalable, reusable, and modular applications where data security and abstraction are important.
- **Use Procedural** for small, simple programs where a straightforward approach is sufficient.

In summary, while the procedural approach works well for simple cases, OOP provides better structure, security, and maintainability, especially for larger and more complex applications.
